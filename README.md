# Employee-Database

You need to create an Employee Management System for a company. This
EMS should be able to add new Employees, update Employee information,
remove Employees, and list Employee information. The user interface (U/I) will
be the terminal console, where you can print the program information, and take in
inputs from the userâ€™s standard input (the keyboard). You will need to have a basic
menu with options to navigate your application for your users to interact with.
